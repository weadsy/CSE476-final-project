    "# Final Project Starting Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello everyone, welcome to the final project! This notebook is provided to you to reiterate the rules and guidelines, and give you some starting points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we provide\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will provide you with \n",
    "- This starting guide\n",
    "- A working API that you can access under ASU network (i.e., on campus or with VPN)\n",
    "- A starting development data that you can use to develop your agent. It contains 1,000 instances with {domain, input, expected_output}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will implement an inference-time agent to solve reasoning requests, as those provided in the development data. The grading of this project will be effort-based and you will get full credit if you produce the minimum deliverables below, with subject to the rules and requirements below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Minimum Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A working agent loop (in the form of a Github project) that the TA can run, and implements *at least three* inference-time algorithms or techniques.\n",
    "2. Outputs from your agent on the released test data (see important dates). \n",
    "3. A short one-page report on how your agent works, and pointer to important techniques (referece to code blocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules and Requirements\n",
    "1. You must only use our provided API call to access LLMs; meaning that you cannot use any other LLMs in any other way within your agent loop. Some exceptions may be made if you call certain external tools (e.g., Google search) that use some LLMs internally. Please discuss any exceptions with us to avoid penalties up to 50% of the project grade.\n",
    "2. You must not hardcode a full delegation to an external tool (e.g., google_search(input_problem)). Such delegations must be automatically selected/decided by your agent. Hardcode delegations will lead to a zero.\n",
    "3. You cannot use Cursor or any AI coding aids to implement the final project. You can, however, ask LLMs (or other online resources) for conceptual clarification or code examples. Your final project should not contain any blocks of code (i.e., > 3 lines) that are written by AI. Violations will lead to a zero.\n",
    "4. Your agent should be able to run efficiently, with <20 LLM calls per question. Exceptions may be made when you have a complicated agent but please discuss with us. Up to 10% of the project grade may be deducted if we observe very inefficient LLM usages that do not clearly benefit the performance.\n",
    "5. Your agent must run without any requests to any paid services (paid is defined by if the TA has to pay to run it, regardless of whether you actuallly pay for it or not.) Violations will lead to a zero.\n",
    "6. You must submit a Github project link as your code submission. All changes must be tracked and any commits should be within 100 lines of +/- with good messages. Points will be deducted to up to 25% of the project grade if we observe \"magic commits\" or too few commits. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions\n",
    "1. Start early, please.\n",
    "2. You should consider how you can evaluate whether your output is good enough compared to the provided expected_outputs, and we will not release how we will actually evaluate your outputs; meaning that you have to try to predict how we will evaluate things.\n",
    "3. Start with a basic implementation, and iterate based on mistakes/feedbacks.\n",
    "4. Find more development data, or create your own cases to stree-test your agent. \n",
    "5. You are free to modify any provided code in this starting guide, or not using any of these code at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important dates\n",
    "- **Release of final test data**: 11/25/2025\n",
    "- **Deadline for submitting all deliverables**: 12/05/2025\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra Credit. \n",
    "The top 20 projects (ranked by performance metrics on the test data and at the TA's discretion of implementation quality) will be given extra credits. The actual credits will be between 1% to 7.5% depending on the ranking."
